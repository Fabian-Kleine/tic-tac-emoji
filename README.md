## üëæ XO Rumble

A tic-tac-toe game that offers both multiplayer and single-player modes.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Single Player

In this mode, you will play against a computer bot.

- Click on the 'Single Player' button to play.
- Choose a player, either "X" or "O".
- The player who gets 3 in a row first wins - the winning row will glow green.
- Whether it's a win, loss, or a draw, a modal displaying the result appears once the game is over. You'll then see two buttons:
  - 'Replay' button to play again.
  - 'Home' button to return to the main menu.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Multiplayer (coming soon)

In this mode, you can play with another person sitting next to you.

- The first player is automatically "X", and the second is "O".
- The player who gets 3 in a row first wins; the winning row will glow green.
- Whether it's a win, loss, or a draw, a modal displaying the result appears once the game is over. You'll then see two buttons:
  - 'Replay' button to play again.
  - 'Home' button to return to the main menu.

## üí° Idea

Project: https://github.com/mirayatech/Tic-Tac-Toe

I've built a tic-tac-toe game before using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which was single-player only. I've always wanted to expand the project by adding multiplayer and making it more interactive. This is why I decided to create this project again, this time using React and TypeScript.

## ü§î How Can It Be Improved?

The project could be improved by adding sound effects and background music. The transitions between pages could also be smoother.

## üö¶ Running the Project

To run the project in your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
